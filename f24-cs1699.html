								<h2>Course Description</h2>
								<p>
									This is an advanced course covering the topics at the intersection of machine learning and game theory. From auction and ads bidding to entertainment games such as Go and Poker, 
									from autonomous driving and traffic routing to home assistants and the Internet of Things, in many applications there is more than one agent interacting with each other. 
									Game theory provides a framework for analyzing the strategic interaction between multiple agents and can complement machine learning when dealing with challenges in these domains. 
									In the course, we will introduce how to integrate machine learning and game theory to tackle challenges in multi-agent systems. Topics covered in this course include:									
									<ul>
										<li>Basics of Machine Learning and Game Theory</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Introduction to convex optimization</li>
											<li>Introduction to game theory</li>
											<li>Introduction to reinforcement learning</li>

								<h2>Paper Presentations</h2>
								<p>
									You will be asked to present two papers in class throughout the semester. The length of each presentation is expected to be around 20 minutes. 
								</p>
								<p>
									You will want to go into the technical details and make sure your classmates understand the ins and outs of the paper. 
									You will also want to critically examine the paper and talk about its strengths and weaknesses. 
									It might help to situate this paper in the literature by finding and reporting on at least one older paper that substantially 
									influenced the current paper and at least one newer paper that is influenced by the current paper. 
									It would also be helpful to propose a couple of follow-up directions that were not mentioned by the paper’s authors.
								</p>
								<p>
									You are required to meet with the instructor to discuss the paper and the presentation, no later than the Monday of the week you are presenting. You may use the designated office hour or email the instructor for additional times.
								</p>									
							</section>

							<section id="project">
								<h2>Course Project</h2>
								<p>
									You will work on a course project related to machine learning and game theory. 
									The progress of projects will be checked through the Project Proposal, Project Progress Report, 
									Project Presentation, and Final Project Report. 
									The proposal and progress reports will be peer-reviewed and graded by the instructor. 
									The presentation and the final report will be evaluated by the instructor directly. 
									Students in CS1699 and CS2099 will have different project requirements and grading criteria.								
								</p>
								<p>
									You may work in groups of 1-3 students. Groups with both CS1699 and CS2099 students will follow the requirements and rubrics of CS2099.
								</p>
								<p>
									Proposal due: September 20th
									<br>
									Progress report due: October 18th
									<br>
									Oral presentations: December 11th
									<br>
									Final report due: December 13th
								</p>

							<h3>
								CS2099 Project Requirements
							</h3>
							<p>
								You will work on an original research project on machine learning and multi-agent systems. You are expected to focus on a particular research 
								problem that fits in the broad set of topics covered in this course and develop novel research contributions. The benchmark for the final 
								project report is at the level of a competitive submission to a workshop at a major AI conference.
							</p>
							<h3>
								CS1699 Project Requirements
							</h3>
							<p>
								You may choose to complete the CS2099 project assignment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Alternatively, you may select an ML competition which involve multi-agent learning and require practical application of techniques covered in class.
								You are expected to analyze the problem and environment and propose appropriate algorithms and strategies to solve the problem. You may discuss multiple approaches 
								and explain the rationale behind selecting a specific method. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The grading scheme is similar to CS2099, except that the expectation is relatively lower on all criteria (e.g., novelty).

								<h2>Course Policies</h2>
								<h3>Grading</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Late-submission policy: You have a total of <b>3 late days</b> for course assignments. Late days cannot be used towards the final project report. The instructor reserves the right not to grade late submissions beyond the allowed late days.</li>
										<li>Re-grading policy: To request a re-grade, please write an email to the instructor titled “Re-grade request from [Student's Full Name]” within one week of receiving the graded assignment.</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
								<h3>Collaboration</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>For the course project, you may collaborate with others outside the class (including students, faculty members, and domain experts) with approval from the instructor. If you work in a team of more than one student, or if you have external collaborators, you need to give proper credits to all parties involved, and report the contributions of each contributor in the proposal, progress report, final report, and presentations, which will be considered in the grading.</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>For the paper presentations, it is allowed to borrow presentation materials from public sources so long as the original source is acknowledged.</li>
									<li>For the course project, it is allowed to use publicly available code packages so long as the source of the code package is acknowledged.</li>
									<li>All writings in the assignments should come from you and do not submit content generated by GPT or similar language models. When in doubt about what you can or cannot use, ask the instructor.</li>
									<li>Plagiarism in any submitted assignments is strictly prohibited. There are serious consequences. Please consult the <a href='http://www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html'>University Guidelines on Academic Integrity</a>.</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								<h3>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h3>
								<p>
									If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and Disability Resources and Services (DRS), 140 William Pitt Union, (412) 648-7890, drsrecep@pitt.edu, (412) 228-5347 for P3 ASL users, as early as possible in the term. DRS will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.
								</p>
								<h3>Accommodations for Students with Medical Conditions</h3>
								<p>
									If you have a medical condition which will prevent you from doing a certain assignment, you must inform the instructor of this before the deadline. You must then submit documentation of your condition within a week of the assignment deadline.
								</p>
								<h3>Statement on Student Wellness</h3>
								<p>
									As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. Pitt services are available, and participation in services does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus here. Support is always available (24/7) from University Counseling Center: 412-648-7930.
